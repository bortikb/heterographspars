Version 1.1
-----------

Some simple changes so that buildHashtable() does its job in a
single pass through the input graph, which is an improvement over
the implementation in Version 1.0. Overall, the code is around 2x
faster (for the sparsifications based on hashing - the code for
the baseline sparsifications is the same).
